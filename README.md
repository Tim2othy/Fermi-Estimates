Here you can find:
1. The data
2. the code that creates some basic plots visualizing the results
3. a PDF generated by the quarto file.


How to understand the plots:
it's always first the persons guess then the persons estimate for what the average guess would be. Tho order of the people is Timothy, Markus, Marvin, Adrian, the mean of all responses.

The normalized errors are normalized in such a way that each question can distribute an error of one so on average a person got an error of 0.25 per question. The read line shows what the average error is. I don't remember how the mean is normalized.


Some of the plots may have mislabeled axes, also not sure if the normalization is working correctly, it's weird that the normalized plot has a higher variance than the non normalized plot, but it is possible.
